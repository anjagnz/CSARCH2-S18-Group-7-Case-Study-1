## 1. Introduction
For this project, we are tasked with building a custom Intel-based entry-level gaming PC designed for users seeking high performance while keeping costs reasonable. The target use case focuses on general gaming at 1080p resolution, aiming to achieve smooth gameplay with graphics settings turned up, while also handling general-purpose computing tasks. The budget for this build is ₱60,000, with a 5% margin of error, making it an excellent all-around option for gamers who want strong performance without overspending.

The components were selected to balance cost and performance. The Intel Core i5-12400F, a 6-core, 12-thread CPU, can handle modern AAA games efficiently, paired with 16 GB of DDR4 memory to support smooth multitasking. Storage consists of a fast 2 TB NVMe SSD for the operating system and frequently used programs, plus an additional 2 TB SATA SSD for extra games and files. The ASRock Challenger D Radeon RX 6600 8 GB graphics card delivers 60+ FPS gameplay at 1080p on current AAA titles. These components leave room for future upgrades as well, which may become necessary as the system ages or as newer games demand higher performance. Together with a reliable motherboard, efficient cooling, a robust power supply, and its versatility, this build offers excellent performance while staying within budget.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-12400F (LGA1700) works with ASRock B660M board (LGA1700 socket, Intel B660 chipset).
- **CPU Cooler**: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE supports LGA1700 socket.
- **RAM**: DDR4 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 128GB).
- **Storage 1**: Silicon Power UD90 (NVME SSD Storage) has good overall performance with its fast and large capacity at 2TB.
- **Storage 2**: Crucial BX500 (SATA SSD) performs well as secondary storage for larger AAA games at 1TB.
- **GPU**: ASRock Challenger OC Arc B580 matches the performance of the CPU in 1080p gaming without bottlenecking.
- **PSU**: MSI MAG A850GL PCIE5 has 850W which supplies adequate power for a gaming build.
- **Case**: Montech XR ATX Mid Tower Case supports motherboard form factor (Micro ATX).
- **Case fans**: Noctua NF-A12x25 provides sufficient airflow for extra gaming support.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱60,000 +/- 5%
- **Final Total**: ₱61,149  
- ✅ Within budget  
- The quality of the GPU was greatly considered, hence why it has the highest price among all the components to support the best gaming experience for 1080p and even higher. We also considered here the space that AAA games take up, as they tend to range from 50B to 150GB, which is why we decided to fully maximize the budget with a 2TB SSD storage and an additional storage of 1TB for good measure. At the same time, the rest of the components perform very well for what it is built for without compromising their quality.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)  

  A comparison of international and Manila vendor prices among the PC components shows that most components' price differences have a **close margin**, generally under 15%, with an **average difference of 7.10%**. Components in this category include the CPU, CPU Cooler, SATA SDD, GPU, PSU, and case fans. This small difference is likely due to factors such as shipping or import costs and exchange rate fluctuations, since some prices are almost similar, like the *Intel Core i5-12400F* and *Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE* international and local pricings. CPUs and GPUs from brands like Intel and ASRock are widely available, which helps keep the prices closely aligned between the two markets.
  
  On the other hand, the motherboard, RAM, NVME SDD, and PC case show **high margins**, ranging from approximately **21.77% to 69.52% difference**. For example, *ASRock B660M Pro RS motherboard* has a higher local price compared to its price in PCPartPicker, likely due to increased shipping costs and its fragility. Conversely, the *Kingston FURY RAM* and *Montech XR mid-tower case* have lower local prices, both of which are from Datablitz, which is a vendor known for low-priced pricing due to distributor deals and promotional offers. Meanwhile, the *Silicon Power UD90 NVME SSD*, with a base price of ₱9,944 on the brand’s official Shopee platform, shows one of the largest markups locally, possibly due to high demand and limited availability of the component locally outside its official stores (Shopee & Lazada), as well as platform fees. The total pricing of the build between international (~₱57,500: when converted) and local ( ₱61,149) differs by a small margin. These comparisons show that prices vary depending on several factors, and while many well-known components have reasonably similar prices internationally and locally, certain items such as those that are fragile or in high demand tend to be significantly more expensive in the Philippines. 

- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents 

  Building a PC was completed successfully within the specified budget however the process was not without a hitch. Most challenges surfaced when looking for local vendors that sell the components the group chose. Some preferred parts were only available in one vendor, Datablitz, which limited the group’s options to choose from vendors that sell them at a lower price. Similarly, other parts were also difficult to locally source as the small number of vendors that sell the products are either unofficial or out of stock. Due to these issues, the group was forced to look for alternatives that offer the same or greater capabilities than the initial preferred components.

- What the group learned about PC components and system design  

  During the process of building the PC that aligns with the needs of being an Intel-based good entry-level gaming device, the group obtained a deeper understanding around its components and system design. Since the PC is for gaming, research was conducted to learn the minimum requirements for the parts to have so that the computer will be able to run AAA games at a high quality. A capable GPU such as the RX 6600 significantly improves the performance of the computer by enabling it to run games at 60+ fps and 1080p quality. In addition, a minimum of 16GB of dual-channel RAM and NVME SSD ensures stable performance and faster loading times. The compatibility of the various components was examined in addition to their respective capabilities. By choosing a chassis that would accommodate the CPU cooler or confirming that the power supply's connectors match the GPU's specifications, the group made sure that every component worked together. Ultimately, the group learned that designing and building a good system is not all about the performance of each component; rather it should also prioritize how well the components can work together.
